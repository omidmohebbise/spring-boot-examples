#Cassandra Hello World
<p>
In this Example I just tried to  develop simple spring boot application to insert a little info into Cassandra database.<br/>
So, Firstly I set up a Cassandra by using docker-compose and secondly create a keyspace manually for storing person table.
Finally run my spring boot application and all things work properly.
