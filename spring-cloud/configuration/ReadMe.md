## Config Server Simple Example

<p>
There is simple example which make it easy to understand server-config configuration.
We have two independent project and a folder that used to store the configuration files.
<b></b>
I just add one configuration file but if we have another client or different environment so this would be possible to add more config files.
<b></b>
</p>
<h1>Run the projects</h1>
<p>
Just check the project out and first run server config project then run client project.
<b></b>
In browser check config server status by this URL
<b></b>
http://localhost:8888/config-client/default
<b></b>
And for client see this URL 
<b></b>
<code>
http://localhost:9999
</code>
