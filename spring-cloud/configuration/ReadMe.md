<h1> Config Server Simple Example</h1>

<p>
There is simple example which make it easy to understand server-config configuration.
We have two independent project and a folder that used to store the configuration files.
<br/>
I just add one configuration file but if we have another client or different environment so this would be possible to add more config files.
</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Run the projects</h1>
<p>

Just check the project out and first run server config project then run client project.<br/>
In browser check config server status by this URL <br/>
<code>
http://localhost:8888/config-client/default
</code>
<br/>
And for client see this URL
<br/>
<code>
http://localhost:9999
</code>
